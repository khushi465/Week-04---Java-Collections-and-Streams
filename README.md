## Overview

Week 4 dives into advanced Java concepts that are crucial for real-world software development. We explored generics, the collections framework, file and stream handling, exception management, pattern matching with regex, unit testing using JUnit, and functional programming with lambda expressions and streams.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Generics

- Introduction to Generics  
- Type Parameters  
- Generic Classes  
- Generic Methods  
- Bounded Type Parameters  
- Wildcards  

### Day 2: Collections Framework

- What is the Collections Framework?  
- Hierarchy of Collections Framework  
- `List` Interface and Implementing Classes  
- `Set` Interface and Implementing Classes  
- `Queue` and `Deque` Interfaces  
- `Map` Interface and Its Implementations  
- Comparison of Different Implementations  
- Real-World Use Cases and Best Practices  

### Day 3: Java I/O Streams

- Overview of Java I/O  
- Types of Streams:
  - File Streams  
  - Object Streams  
  - ByteArray Streams  
  - Buffered Streams  
  - Reader and Writer  
- Key Considerations  
- Best Practices  

### Day 4: Exception Handling

- Types of Exceptions  
  - Checked Exceptions  
  - Unchecked Exceptions  
- Handling Exceptions:
  - `try-catch` blocks  
  - `try-catch-finally` blocks  
  - `try-with-resources` statement  
  - `throw` statement  
  - `throws` clause  
- Creating Custom Exceptions  
  - Extending Exception Class  
  - Defining Constructors  

### Day 5: Regular Expressions & JUnit

#### Regular Expressions (Regex)

- MetaCharacters  
- Quantifiers  
- Common Patterns:
  - Email Validation  
  - Password Strength  
  - Phone Number Format  
- Java Regex API:
  - `Pattern`  
  - `Matcher`  
  - Methods: `find()`, `matches()`, `replaceAll()`  

#### JUnit Introduction

- Introduction to JUnit Framework  
- JUnit Annotations  
- Writing Test Cases  
- Structure of a Test Class  
- Assertions  

### Day 6: Functional Programming Features

- Java Interface Types  
- Lambda Expressions  
- Stream API  
- Method References  
- Anonymous Classes  

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Java fundamentals, OOP, and basic data structures (Weeks 1–3)  
- JDK and Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code)  
- Familiarity with file handling and basic error handling  

## How to Use This Repository

Each day's folder contains code samples, documentation, and exercises to reinforce the topics covered. Study the examples, run the code, and modify them to enhance your understanding of these advanced concepts.

## Next Steps

In Week 5, we will explore I/O Programming in Java, including file handling, stream operations, serialization, and working with Java’s I/O classes for reading and writing data.
